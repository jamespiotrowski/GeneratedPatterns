# Generated Patterns - Overview
This is a program that generates image data for computer vision classification. 

For applications in which a data set of a scalable size is needed. For example, this program will be used to generate many data sets of different sizes to evaluate neural network efficiency in process-oriented programming languages. To truly observe the efficiency, data sets of different sizes should be used. The pattern generator program allows you to generate multiple image data sets of any size in which each data set contains the same image content! 

In this repository you will find:
 * **PatternGenerator** - The program built to generate image data (code only).
 * **PatternRecognizer** - A program that utilizes a fully connected neural network to recognize the generate data (code only).
 * **PatternsForMLSpeed.pdf** - A paper describing the methodologies used in this project and results from testing the data.
 * **DataSets** - Some data sets generated by this program. These data sets are referenced in the paper.
 * **SampleImages** - Some sample images generated by the program.
